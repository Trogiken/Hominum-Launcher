#### HOW TO USE UPDATER ####

1. Open the folder that matches the operating system you're using

2. Open the "HominumUpdater" executable

3. Click "Sync Modpack"

Once finished, the window behind the GUI should say "Finished Syncing Mods"
If anything else abnormal appears, consult the oopsies below.

#### Oopsies ####

* If a window opens asking for a folder, that means the program coudln't find your mods folder.
  See the modpack-installation channel for more info on how to find this mods folder.
  When clicking the select button on the bottom right, be sure that the "mods" folder is the
  only folder selected.
* If the window behind the GUI says anything about an error.txt, this file is located in the same
  folder as the HominumUpdater application.
  You may send this file to creme__fraiche if the problem doesn't resolve itself by restarting the program.
